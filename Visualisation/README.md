The workshop will be mostly practical and will start from the point where relatively clean data has been loaded into a notebook. Attendees will be given an overview of basic visualisation principals, an introduction to some of the main visualisation options in Python and a demonstration. They will then work to create exploratory visualisations and answer questions from the datasets.

# Resources

* [10 minutes to pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) is useful to learn more about data preparation and manipulation
